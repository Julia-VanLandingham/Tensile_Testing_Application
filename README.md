# Tensile Testing Application
The purpose of this application is to assist in testing the tensile strength of materials.
This software is designed to pull force and elongation data from the appropriate machines through a connected National Instruments device. This data allows for the stress-strain graph to be drawn in real time using the corresponding cross-section and gauge length values input by the user. Lastly, the data can be exported to a CSV file that can then be opened and manipulated in Excel easily. 

A full user manual can be found in the "documents" folder.
